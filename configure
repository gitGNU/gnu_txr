usage: $0 { variable=value }*

The configure script prepares txr program for compilation and installation.
To configure a program means to establish the values of Makefile variables
which influence how the software is built, where it is installed.
These variables can also influence what features are present in the
software, and can determine various defaults for those behaviors which are
dynamically configurable when the software is run.

Configuration variables are recorded in a file called config.make. This is a
GNU makefile, and consequently uses the GNU make syntax. It is included in the
main Makefile by an include statement.

The configure script is flexible. It allows variables to be entered in any
of these forms:

Canonical:

   variable=value      Defines the given variable as having the given value.
   variable=           Defines the variable as having an empty value.
                       An empty value serves as boolean false.

Long-option style:

   --variable=value    Same as 'variable=value', but resembles a GNU-style
                       long option.
   --variable          Same as 'variable=y'.
   --no-variable       Same as 'variable='.

No variables are required. The configure script establishes default values
for any variables which are needed by the build, but which are not specified
on the command line.

After running $0, check that the config.make contents are sane.

The following variables are supported.  Note that Makefile variable syntax may
be used in paths. Default values are shown in [square brackets].

prefix [$prefix]

  Specifies root directory where the software will ultimately be installed and
  run from.

install_prefix [$install_prefix]

  Specifies an extra path prefix that will be prepended to all paths during
  installation. This allows the software to be installed in a temporary
  directory for packaging.

bindir [$bindir]

  Specifies where the program executable will be installed.

datadir [$datadir]

  Specifies where read-only program data is to be stored.

mandir [$mandir]

  Specifies the directory where to install man pages.

cross

  Specifies the root of a cross-compiling toolchain.
  This becomes the \$(cross) variable in the Makefile, and by default
  will be added as a prefix to all of the toolchain commands.
  It should include the trailing slash, unless the \$compiler_prefix
  and \$tool_prefix variables take care of this by providing a leading slash.

compiler_prefix [$compiler_prefix]

  Specifies a prefix to be added to the compiler command.
  This is added to the \$(cross) prefix. This can include some path name
  components, and a name fragment. For instance, if
  \$cross is "/cross/toolchain/" and \$compiler_prefix is
  "bin/mips-linux-" then the compiler command, unless otherwise
  specified, will be "/cross/toolchain/bin/mips-linux-gcc".

cc [$cc]

  Specifies the name of the toolchain front-end driver command to use for
  compiling C sources to object files, and for linking object files to
  executables. This becomes the CC variable in the Makefile.

tool_prefix [$tool_prefix]

  Specifies a prefix to be added to tool commands other than the
  compiler, like lex and yacc, in addition to \$cross.

lex [$lex]

  Specifies the program to use for compiling lex scanners to C.
  This must be compatible with GNU flex, since flex extensions are used.

lexlib [$lexlib]

  Specifies the linker flag to use for linking the lex library.

yacc [$yacc]

  Specifies the program to use for compiling yacc scanners to C.

opt_flags [$opt_flags]

  Specifies optimization flags to use for compiling and linking
  C sources.

lang_flags [$lang_flags]

  Specifies compiler flags which control the C language dialect and standard
  conformance in the language and header files. The txr program is written
  in C90, and requires POSIX and possibly other extensions.

diag_flags [$diag_flags]

  Specifies compiler flags for obtaining extra diagnostics.

debug_flags [$debug_flags]

  Specifies flags for requesting that debugging information be
  retained in the compile and link.

inline_flags [$inline_flags]

  Specifies flag for defining a macro that expands to a suitable
  compiler-specific inline specifier.

lex_dbg_flags [$lex_dbg_flags]

  Specifies debug flags to be passed to lex, perhaps to generate a debugging
  scanner.

txr_dbg_opts [$txr_dbg_opts]

  Specifies debug flags to pass to the txr program during the execution
  of "make tests".

Configuration seems to have been successful. The next
step is one of these two.

Method 1: if you have permissions to the installation directories:
   make install

Method 2: if you have to or want to be another user such as root to install:
   make
   su <userid>
   (give password, if asked)
   make install
